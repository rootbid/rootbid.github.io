Atmosphere is what allows life on Earth, it's a layer of gases surrounding the
planet that is retained by the planet's gravity. Carbon dioxide is the most
significant long-lived gas in our atmosphere which is responsible for life on
Earth. Without carbon dioxide the light from the sun falling on earth would simply bounce back into
space, while the presence of carbon dioxide absorbs the light from sun and
allow heating the planet for life to exist. From the dawn of Industrial Revolution (use of fossil fuels and deforestation),
we have rapidly increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere; leading to global warming. It's threatening to push the planet past a tipping point
beyond which climate change would be difficult to stop and It’s suicidal to
think that we can do nothing and continue like that for centuries.

## Understanding the problem
As mathematics teaches us, the first step towards a solution is to define the
problem(s).

If we think about ecological breakdown; there are two problems: *1. Climate
change and 2. the accelerated destruction of biodiversity.* Human-induced climate change includes
both global warming and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns.
While the most dreadful outcome of global warming is still awaited, ruination
of the environment is already affecting our food, water and air.

## The world we are creating
Our world is getting hotter. Over the next two decades projections tell us that temperature in some areas of
the globe will rise even higher, the future will remain uncertain for a lot of
people (and by that, I mean you, me and our families). Everyone is extremely
vulnerable. Rise in sea levels due to melting of the ice sheets, permafrost
spewing greenhouse gases, wildfires, mudslides, floods and severe tornados are making
our lives miserable.

While everyone is debating carbon neutrality, we are accelerating the
destruction of what enables us to live.
- We are destroying the soils with our non-biodegradable waste and shameless use of
  fetilizers
- We are buying stuff with a lot of useless packaging
- We are buying gadgets (manufactured in distant places of the world, transported and delivered to our doorsteps) which are replaced every 2-3 years with new gadgets
- We are buying new cars with bigger infotainment systems and improved visual
  aesthetics

## The future we choose

> [The actions we pursue are largely defined by the mindset we cultivate in advance of the doing. When we are faced with an urgent task, it may feel counterintutuive to first look inside ourselves, but it is essential.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52117860-the-future-we-choose)

While I'm not going to pretend to know how to solve these problems, here's what
I consider are few good ideas to improve the quality of human life for
centuries to come.
1. **Eliminating waste**
- The primary step to reduce waste is *repairability*. We must buy stuff for
life, from companies that embrace repairability. Things break, which is normal but we or a trained technician should be able to repair it.
- Reject new technology like Next-gen gaming consoles, mobile devices with 5G
  support and other single purpose gadgets. Sure, 5G allows you to stream in 4k
but does it really matter on a 6-inch form factor?
- Don't buy gadgets that are used less than a few times in a year. Only buy
  multi purpose stuff.
- Fix stuff around you.
2. **Eliminating pollution**
- Don't own a car, use a bicycle or public transport.
- Reduce transportation by adopting remote work and planning less holidays to
  the other side of the planet. Keep in mind transportation is not only your
personal transportation, it’s also the transportation of everything you use and
eat: Food, gadgets, materials, appliances.
- Live rural, buy local. Start a mostly vegetarian diet.


At this point we have a responsibility to do what is necessary, and for most of
us that will involve some deliberate reprogramming of our minds.

## Interesting projects
1. [The Framework Laptop](https://frame.work/); fixing the consumer elctronics
   industry by desiging products to last.
2. [Open Source Ecology](https://www.opensourceecology.org/); focused on building an efficient economy while sharing
   and innovating by open collaboration.
